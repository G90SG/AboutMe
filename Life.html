Hey, I'm Gemma! 
<br>
</h1>
I live in Birmingham with my other half, Alex and our Dog Louis. 
<br> 
I currently work as a Project Manager within an insurance company, with a focus on IT based projects and system development. This work has peaked my interest in web, systems and app development and so I went in search of a beginners course, which I found with Tech Talent Academy.
<br>
 My partner's passion is classic cars and this seems to have worn off on me over the years, having recently bought a 1991 Porsche 944 S2.
<br>
In my spare time I practice yoga, love to cook and spend time in the great outdoors walking our little pup.
