Hey, I'm Gemma! 
<br>
</h1>
<p1>
I live in Birmingham with my other half, Alex and our Dog Louis. Louis is a 5 month old miniature long haired dachshund and the cheekiest chappy you will ever meet.

I currently work as a Project Manager within an insurance company specialising in Private Clients and Performance Vehicles.<br>
My focus has primarily been IT based projects and system development. For the past 3 years I have been project managing the implementation of a new online Client Portal, with it's third phase shortly to be released, our clients and brokers will benefit from a fully automated policy placement process and online document repository. This digital transformation has been created around an existing client base of over 7000 clients and so it has not come without it's challenges.<br>
This work has peaked my interest in web, systems and app development and so I went in search of a beginners course, which I found with Tech Talent Academy.

My partner's passion is classic cars and this seems to have worn off on me over the years, having recently bought a 1991 Porsche 944 S2.
<br>
In my spare time I practice yoga, love to cook and spend time in the great outdoors walking our little pup.
<br>
I've added my favourite yoga video below, from Yoga With Adriene. This is one of my go to videos for a quick wake up yoga session in the morning.
